## API
**A**pplication **P**rogramming **I**nterface  

*An API is a contract between application (app) and service.*

* Consumer vs Provider
  * A software app is often the **consumer** of an API.
  * When an API is offered over a network for consumption, the service that offers the API is said to be the **provider** or "API provider."

* The app may outsource requirements for data or functionality through an API by **calling** that API. To illustrate...
  * Patient record
  * Location represented as a pin on a map
  * The execution of a financial transaction
  
* It's a technical contract
  * Like a legal contract, it represents an understanding by all parties involved
  * The contract also represents agreed-upon standards




## REST
**RE**presentational **S**tate **T**ransfer

* Architectural style of the web
* A standard / set of guidelines by which you can structure and create APIs
* REST APIs have identifiable properties...
  * They make use of Resource-based URLs
